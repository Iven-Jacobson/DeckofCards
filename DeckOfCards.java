// Project: Lab 2: Card Shuffling and Dealing Program 

// Purpose : This is the DeckOfCards class that holds the methods to contruct
// a standard deck of playing cards.

// I took the source code from the file below and modified it for this Lab.
// I modified the shuffle method to use the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle Algorithm
// instead of the one pass method in the original code.

// Fig. 7.12: DeckOfCards.java
// DeckOfCards class represents a deck of playing cards.

   private Card[] deck = new Card[NUMBER_OF_CARDS]; // Card references
   private int currentCard = 0; // index of next Card to be dealt (0-51)

   // constructor fills deck of Cards
